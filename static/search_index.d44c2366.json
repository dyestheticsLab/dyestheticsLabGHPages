First, we modified our .vscode settings to point to our prompts and\ncode generation files. You can find more information on how to do this in this\nlink.\n\nNext, we started creating the instructions. For instance, in the file\n.github/copilot-instructions.md, we specified that we use React 19, a monorepo\nsetup, and included health advice and words of encouragement—because empathy\nmatters.\n\nNow, GitHub Copilot Chat provides answers while keeping those files in context\nwith our custom instructions.\n\n\nThe Prompt File#\n\nTo create components using one of our packages, we needed to reference the code\nof that package. GitHub Copilot documentation suggests doing this in the form of\nmarkdown links. Since we have the code in the same monorepo, we can reference it\ndirectly. However, if you are using our libraries without direct access to the\nsource code in the same repository, how can this be solved?\n\nYou can reference the code in your node_modules folder, including the\ncorresponding typings. While the JavaScript code is minified and harder for\nGitHub Copilot to use, the typings are still accessible.\n\nHere’s an example of how to do this:\n\n\n\nMake sure to adjust the paths relative to the location of your prompt file.\n\n\nFinal Words#\n\nYes, we should document the API and typings in our libraries to further enhance\nAI code generation. Nevertheless, this example can be expanded to other\nscenarios and libraries beyond our own.","routePath":"/dyestheticsLabGHPages/blog/using-gh-copilot","lang":"","toc":[{"text":"The Prompt File","id":"the-prompt-file","depth":2,"charIndex":914},{"text":"Final Words","id":"final-words","depth":2,"charIndex":1636}],"domain":"","frontmatter":{},"version":""},{"id":2,"title":"Component react creators","content":"#\n\n\nWhat does it do?#\n\nThese utilities are actually react component factories for what some libraries\nlike MUI and Mantine know as Polymorphic Components and also to create\ncomponents that extract some props and use them to resolve the className. There\nis a reason we are creating this; we have some ideas in mind following the\narticle we published in medium to create some optimizations in build/compile\ntime.\n\nIn short, this means you can create a Button that can render not only as a\nbutton but as any other React ElementType.\n\nAlso you are going to be able to create a className resolver function that\nextracts from your props what info is needed to create a className according to,\nfor instance, some variants of your component, and separate them from the real\nprops of the component.\n\nI almost forgot to mention that it is typesafe, so your IDE is going to\nautocomplete the needed props.\n\n> ⚠️ WARNING: This library is only compatible with React 19. It will not work\n> with earlier versions of React due to dependency on new features and APIs\n> introduced in React 19.\n\n\nInstallation#\n\n\nUsage#\n\n\nCreating a styled component#\n\nThis is a factory of a polymorphic component that also accepts variant props for\nyour custom className resolver\n\n\n\nThe extractStyleProps is a needed function to separate what props are real props\nof your component (componentOwnProps) and what props are going to be used to\nresolve the className (styleProps).\n\nThe classNameResolver will only get what you defined in extractStyleProps as\nstyleProps and you may use that to form your final className to get the correct\nstyles.\n\nSometimes you would want not to modify the className but the style prop, this is\nto apply change control via css vars; for those cases we provide a styleResolver\nfunction.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn any case, you can use the Button component like this:\n\n\n\n\nExample with tailwindVariants and Rambda#\n\n\n\nThen you can use your shiny button like this\n\n\n\nWhy would I want a button that is a link? Well, because sometimes you need the\nstyles of a button in an anchor tag.\n\n\nCreating a only polymorphic component#\n\nBut if you do not want to create a custom className resolver and only need a\npolymorphic component you can use createReactMetaComponent\n\n\nCreating a component that extracts some props to create the className#\n\nBut this time it is not a polymorphic component, you can use\ncreateComponentWithStyleProps and the component is not going to have an as prop.\n\n\n\nThis component is always going to be a button.\n\n\nFinal words#\n\nObviously you may use directly a classname resolver of your liking directly in\nany component directly in the code like this (suppose we were using\ntailwindVariants):\n\n\n\nAnd it is really good, but we wanted to give some structure to react components\nto make them have all your variants by props.\n\nIf you read the article about our ideas that came from our adventures in the\nplace where we study, you may know we are planning on using a compiler to make\nsome optimizations at build time.\n\nAnd since react is something that is going to be in our projects, we wanted to\nmake the first step in this direction.","routePath":"/dyestheticsLabGHPages/guide/component-creators","lang":"","toc":[{"text":"What does it do?","id":"what-does-it-do","depth":2,"charIndex":3},{"text":"Installation","id":"installation","depth":2,"charIndex":1076},{"text":"Usage","id":"usage","depth":2,"charIndex":1092},{"text":"Creating a styled component","id":"creating-a-styled-component","depth":2,"charIndex":1101},{"text":"Example with tailwindVariants and Rambda","id":"example-with-tailwindvariants-and-rambda","depth":3,"charIndex":1845},{"text":"Creating a only polymorphic component","id":"creating-a-only-polymorphic-component","depth":2,"charIndex":2056},{"text":"Creating a component that extracts some props to create the className","id":"creating-a-component-that-extracts-some-props-to-create-the-classname","depth":2,"charIndex":2234},{"text":"Final words","id":"final-words","depth":2,"charIndex":2500}],"domain":"","frontmatter":{},"version":""},{"id":3,"title":"Introduction","content":"#\n\nWe are creating several libraries to help us build design systems, especially\nfor React.js. It is going to be a long journey ahead of us.\n\nThis idea was born during a university project where we were challenged to meet\nseveral constraints because we asked for a more demanding task.\n\nWe know there are many excellent tools out there that are evolving rapidly,\noffering great developer experience (DX), decent performance, and portability.\nHowever, they did not fully meet 100% of the requirements we were tasked with,\nsuch as:\n\n * Short build times\n * No runtime overhead\n * 90% CSS coverage\n * Compatibility with React Server Components (RSC) and runtime style\n   information (SSR)\n * Good JSX developer experience\n\n\nProjects That Inspire Us#\n\nWhile researching tools to assist with our project, we discovered some amazing\nlibraries that inspired us or even became the foundation of our tools. We are\ndeeply grateful to the open-source community for their incredible work:\n\n * Radix\n * Tamagui\n * Stitches\n * Mantine\n * UnoCSS\n * Tailwind\n * Tailwind Variants\n\n\nSome Context...#\n\nFor example, we wanted to use a CSS variant generator because you often don't\nknow what variants you'll need at compile time. All the classes representing\npossible states of that variant were generated, but the CSS coverage was not\nacceptable to our mentors.\n\nThen we discovered Tamagui, which was wonderful because it optimized JSX by\nextracting variants and creating a CSS file with only the classes that were\nused. We love Tamagui.\n\nHowever, we needed to use the components as RSC, and the styles were not known\nahead of time for those RSC components since we were fetching that information\nfrom a remote data source (SSR).\n\nThe heuristics for compiling a component were lost because we didn't know which\nvariant value to apply until runtime.\n\nThis is why we are building tools to help us create, with luck, a complete\nframework that addresses all the constraints we are facing.\n\nIn this context, we do not aspire to replace these very powerful libraries. We\nare simply experimenting with some ideas.\n\n\nThe Road Ahead#\n\nCurrently, we are building a library of React component creators and, around\nthat, a Tailwind wrapper using Tailwind Variants (we love Tailwind Variants).\n\nTo address the missing responsive variants, we are creating a Babel loader and a\nVite plugin to generate all the responsive variants at compile time.\n\nNext, we plan to create an SWC plugin to extract only the necessary classes from\nJSX syntax and transform them into optimized components with only the required\nTailwind classes.\n\nThe component creator will assist us in development mode while we learn enough\nRust to create the plugin.\n\nFor RSC components with runtime data sources, we aim to create a set of Next.js\nutilities to register the required classes during SSG mode. These utilities will\nuse the resolved values to generate only the necessary classes in the CSS file\nand inline the critical CSS.\n\nFor client components, the approach is slightly different. We are exploring ways\nto extract the classes passed to the client component from the server component,\npossibly using a proxy.\n\nThese approaches will require a strong set of rules and conventions, which we\nneed to effectively communicate through warnings and linter rules.\n\nAs you can see, there is a lot of work to do, and we are just getting started.\n\n\nWhat We Have So Far#\n\nWe have several packages, but the three most useful are:\n\n@dyesthetics-lab/react-component-creators This is our base library for creating\npolymorphic components with styles and variants.\n\n * @dyesthetics-lab/react-tv-variants-creators A wrapper around Tailwind\n   Variants and @dyesthetics-lab/react-component-creators to create responsive\n   variants. Note: This does not work as a standalone library.\n\n * @dyesthetics-lab/tailwind-manifest-creators To effectively create responsive\n   variants, we need to generate a manifest with all the responsive variants so\n   TailwindCSS can read it and generate the required CSS. This module includes\n   loaders and plugins to help with this process. (We are also planning to offer\n   a codegen CLI as an alternative to this package.)\n\nYou can test the following libraries:\n\n * @dyesthetics-lab/react-component-creators\n * @dyesthetics-lab/react-tv-variants-creators\n * @dyesthetics-lab/tailwind-utils\n * @dyesthetics-lab/tailwind-manifest-creators\n * @dyesthetics-lab/tailwind-utils\n\n\nCan I Help Out?#\n\nOf course! We are looking for contributors to help us with the project. We want\nto learn, but we are currently very busy with university, so please be patient\nif we don't respond immediately. Nevertheless, any PR from a fork will be\nreviewed within the same week it is submitted.\n\n\nFinal Words#\n\nWe are here to learn and greatly appreciate any feedback you can provide.\n\nAdditionally, we have an article that inspired this project. We created the\nlibraries shortly after the article was published.","routePath":"/dyestheticsLabGHPages/guide/","lang":"","toc":[{"text":"Projects That Inspire Us","id":"projects-that-inspire-us","depth":2,"charIndex":720},{"text":"Some Context...","id":"some-context","depth":2,"charIndex":1065},{"text":"The Road Ahead","id":"the-road-ahead","depth":2,"charIndex":2089},{"text":"What We Have So Far","id":"what-we-have-so-far","depth":2,"charIndex":3383},{"text":"Can I Help Out?","id":"can-i-help-out","depth":2,"charIndex":4433},{"text":"Final Words","id":"final-words","depth":2,"charIndex":4733}],"domain":"","frontmatter":{},"version":""},{"id":4,"title":"Tailwind Manifest Creators","content":"#\n\n\nIntroduction#\n\nThe @dyesthetics-lab/tailwind-manifest-creators package creates manifest files\ncontaining all Tailwind CSS class variants used in your project.

This manifest enables\nTailwind to efficiently process only the classes your application actually\nneeds, improving build performance and reducing CSS bundle size.\n\nWARNING\n\nThis package is specifically designed to work with Tailwind CSS v4, which\nintroduced the @source directive for improved class extraction.\n\n\nInstallation#\n\n\nUsage#\n\n\nManifest Creator#\n\nThe package exports a createManifest function that generates a manifest file\ncontaining all Tailwind class variants that match a specified glob pattern.\n\nTo implement this in your build process, create a pre-build script file (e.g.,\npre-build.ts):\n\n\n\nThe globPath parameter specifies which files to scan for Tailwind class\ndefinitions. In this example, we're searching for all files with the\n.tailwindConfig.json extension.\n\n\nConfiguration Files#\n\nYour project should contain one or more configuration files matching the\nspecified glob pattern. These files define the Tailwind variants your components\nuse.\n\nExample tailwindConfig.json:\n\n\n\nINFO\n\nNote that the responsiveVariants option in your configuration controls whether\nresponsive variants are generated. When set to true, the manifest will include\nresponsive variants (like sm:, md:, lg:) for your classes.
